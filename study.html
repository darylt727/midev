<h2>Memory Tips for Students</h2>

<p>Don't wait until your next big exam to try and cram information into your memory. Begin using these techniques to effectively improve your memory and information retention.</p>
<img src="../images/library.JPG" width="275" height="200" />
<h3>Study Tip #1 - Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Focus your attention on the materials you are studying.</p> 
<ul>
<li><b>Remove distractions</b> such as television, music, the Internet - anything that diverts your attention from the material you're focusing on.</li>
<li><b>Be present</b> - Concentrate on the new material. Use as many senses as you can in learning the material so that your consciousness becomes raised while processing the new material.</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid cramming</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Establish regular study sessions</b>. Review, and the repetition that comes with it, help new information commit itself into long-term memory. </li><img src="../images/study_group.jpg" width="175" height="120" align="right" />
<li><b>Risk of burnout</b> - you're trading sleep for study, an activity that requires attention and concentration, which are qualities that diminish from tiredness. <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/cramming-for-a-test-don-t-do-it-237733">Research from UCLA</a> supports the notion that cramming is counter-productive. "No one is suggesting that students shouldn't study," said (UCLA professor of psychiatry Andrew) Fuligni, the study's senior author. "But an adequate amount of sleep is also critical for academic success. These results are consistent with emerging research suggesting that sleep deprivation impedes leaning."</li>
</ul>
<h3>Study Tip #2 - Use Memory Techniques and Strategies</h3>
<p>Structure and organize the information you are studying.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Try grouping</b> the new material into similar concepts and terms together. Write your groupings down if that helps, and make your groups into an outline. Then, once you've established groups for your new material, try linking the new information to related concepts that you already know. </li>
<li><b>Take time to think</b> about how the new information that you're studying relates to things that you already know. You will be associating new concepts with information that already makes sense to you. When that happens, the new information becomes more meaningful, and at once becomes easier to organize and remember.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use mnemonic devices to remember information - A mnemonic device, is any learning technique that aids information retention - the use of acronyms and imagery are just a couple of memorization techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Acronym Example</b> - To memorise the North American Great Lakes: the acronym HOMES - matching the letters of the five lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior)</li>
<li><b>Imagery Example</b> - There's a reason books and newspapers illustrate concepts with photographs, charts, maps, and other graphics - many people benefit from visualizing information. Pay attention to these graphics, or create your own. One way to create your visual mnemonic is illustrated by this example: "DOC" represents phases of the Moon by shape as viewed from the northern hemisphere: "D" is the waxing moon; "O" the full moon; and "C" the waning moon.</li>
<li>Wikipedia has an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mnemonics">extensive list of mnemonics</a>, and one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_visual_mnemonics">visual mnemonics</a>.</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Study Tip #3 - Recreate the Initial Learning Experience</h3>
<p>Elaborate and rehearse the information you are studying. - The concept of Elaborative Rehearsal is a technique for encoding new material into long-term memory. It is the process of making connections between pieces of newly learned information and connecting it to what you already know, making it more meaningful and easier to recall.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Outlines</b> - Using outlines makes you repeat the information, and more effectively, presents the new information in groupings.</li>
<li><b>Relating two concepts to one another</b> in order to give them meaning - Some words in Spanish like <i>abandonar</i> can be remember easily because it is associated with the English word "abandon". </li>
<li><b>Speaking the new information out loud</b> - Repeat it to yourself, or explain it to someone else. Try using this approach by teaching new concepts and information to a study partner.</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Study Tip #4 - Stay Fresh</h3>
<p><b>Vary your study routine</b> - It seems counter-intuitive, and appears to contradict the other tips on this page that aim towards building regular habits. But sometimes a routine can become just that - another routine. If you have an established routine, but are just going through the motions, it might be time to think about changing things up. Choose a different study spot. Try reviewing information in the morning if you always study at night. The smallest change can reinvigorate a stale routine.</p>

<p><b>Get some sleep</b> - Is there any debate about how we all perform better when we've had enough rest? Cramming at the last minute sacrifices this necessary requirement and puts students at an immediate disadvantage for both remembering new material and on performance for the next day's exam.</p>

				<h2>DID YOU KNOW?</h2>
<p>That the simple act of walking through a doorway can cause you to go suddenly blank? We've all walked into a room and suddenly realized that we can't remember why we needed to be there. Researchers have found that the simple act of walking through a doorway can cause a memory lapse when trying to recall a purpose that was initiated in another room before.  </p>
